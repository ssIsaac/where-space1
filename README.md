## A productivity themed web app 

Londonâ€™s growing student and professional population faces a persistent challenge: the scarcity of suitable study spaces. 
To address this issue, we developed a web application that allows users to discover, review, and share study spaces across the city. 
The platform provides crowdsourced reviews, ratings, and key details on study environments, helping users find the ideal location based on their preferences. 
Additionally, the app facilitates peer collaboration by enabling users to organize and join study sessions, fostering a productive and interactive learning community. 
By combining location-based discovery with a social approach to studying, this web app enhances accessibility to study spaces while encouraging academic collaboration in London.
